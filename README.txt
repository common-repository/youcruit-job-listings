== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an account at YouCruit to use this plugin? =
Yes, you need an employer account to manage your open positions and applications.

= Is YouCruit free for employers to use? =
Yes. Although we do offer additional paid features and posting open positions to premium job boards, you can use the system completely free for up to 5 users. Visit [youcruit.com](https://www.youcruit.com) for more information.

= The job descriptions are shown on bold, can I change to normal weight? =
There are two possible reasons. First, you might have the [youcruit_ads] tag set in bold. Remove the bold to possible solve the problem. Second, the styling is inherited from your Wordpress styling, so if the tag is added where text is bold, the YouCruit jobs will also be bold. In this last case, you need to check your site styling and placement of the [youcruit_ads] tag to solve the issue.
